# Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

If you don't already have a userscript manager installed in your browser, you'll need one to use Tsubakis-GroundCloud. We recommend using either Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey.

#### For Tampermonkey:

2. Click on the "Download" button to install Tampermonkey.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided by your browser.

#### For Violentmonkey:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the [Violentmonkey extension page](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Click on the "Install" button to install Violentmonkey.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided by your browser.

### Step 2: Install the Tsubakis-GroundCloud Userscript

Once you have a userscript manager installed, follow these steps to install the Tsubakis-GroundCloud userscript:

1. Go to the [Tsubakis-GroundCloud GitHub repository](https://github.com/trevorftp/Tsubakis-GroundCloud).
2. Click on the `Tsubakis-GroundCloud.user.js` file.
3. Click on the "Raw" button to view the raw contents of the script.
4. Your userscript manager should detect the script and open a new tab prompting you to install it. If not, copy the entire script.
5. Paste the script into a new script file in your userscript manager.
6. Ensure the script is set to run at "document-body".
7. Save the script, and you're all set!
